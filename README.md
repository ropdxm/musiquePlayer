# 🎵 MusiquePlayer - a music listening platform that unites people with music :sparkling_heart:
This is a react-based app where you can explore different music and add your most-beloved songs to favourites. 

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Next.js** - For SSR and frontend framework
- **React** - UI component-based development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Fast and responsive styling
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth UI animations
- **Redux** - State management for player & favorites
- **expressjs** - for small, yet powerful api
- **multer** - store and manage mp3 and photo files

I chose this tech stack, because I felt like it resonated within me. I also wanted to share my creativity and passion as effectively as possible, which the above-mentioned stack managed to do a great job. I had a lot of experience with nextjs and expressjs in the past 3 years, so it only makes sense for me to work with tools that I am good at.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Built with Next.js & React**  
✅ **Styled using Tailwind CSS**

How to use? Go to https://musique-player.vercel.app/ to see live demo.
Or "git clone https://musique-player.vercel.app/" and do "npm install".
You don't even need to clone the project locally to your machine. Everything is hosted on Vercel, including server, which you can see on: https://github.com/ropdxm/nfacserver

# Issue:
One limitation could be the lack of rating system. I wanted to implement the system the user can leave. Though, I came to a compromise. I decided to add the favourites system instead, which allows users to save their beloved songs in a server.

I used agile methodology to develop and it took me around 2.5-3 days to complete.

🎵 *Enjoy the music! 🎶*
